## About this app
- This application had a lot of it's inspiration drawn from a need to have a safe environment where users could gather to talk about code and tech. The idea behind this app is that users can come in and enjoy the content without having to login. If you would like to participate, we invite you to join in with Auth0 authentication for security. 

### What can I do with this app
- You can meet other developers, designers, project managers and all around tech people that enjoy the same things you do. You can start a discussion within a subtopic or simply originate your own subtopic if you feel it's a vast topic. Found a discussion you like, or don't like? Feel free to upvote or downvote it to let others know what you think of it. Found a particular subtopic that you enjoy? Join it and see it in your joined subtopics so that you can find it easier. Looking for a particular subject or category of discussions? Use our built from scratch hashtag system to locate what you're looking for or hashtag your own discussions while you're making them. Don't like the username or image that auth0 gives you when you login with them? You can just move on over to your user settings page and update your information.
